# How Software Engineers Should Do Good Research: The D in R&D

Research is one of the least visible skills in software engineering-and one of the most important.
We celebrate shipping and execution, but strong execution is usually the *result* of quiet, continuous research that no one notices.

This post focuses on the **D (Development)** side of R&D, and why good development depends on **ongoing research**, even when it feels like it’s not paying off day by day.

## Why Research Matters in an SWE’s Life

Software engineering is not just about writing code. It’s about making decisions under uncertainty.

Good research helps you:

* Avoid cargo-cult engineering
* Understand *why* something works, not just *how*
* Choose tools intentionally instead of following trends
* Anticipate breaking changes, limitations, and risks

Strong engineers don’t know everything.
They know **how to reduce uncertainty faster than others**.

## Research Is Ongoing (and Often Feels Useless)

One of the hardest truths about research is this:

> **Daily research rarely feels productive.**

You read release notes that don’t matter *today*.
You skim docs for features you won’t use *yet*.
You follow discussions that don’t immediately affect your code.

And still-this is where long-term engineering clarity comes from.

Research compounds quietly. 
What feels irrelevant today becomes obvious context six months later.

## How to Research Tools Effectively

Before adopting a language, framework, or library, research beyond “does it work”.

### 1. Know the Language

* Read official documentation (not just tutorials)
* Understand the runtime model:

  * Memory management
  * Concurrency
  * Async vs blocking

* Learn the language’s philosophy

### 2. Know the Framework

Ask questions like:

* Who maintains it?
* How opinionated is it?
* How fast does it change?
* Is it a thin abstraction or a heavy one?
* What problems was it *actually* designed to solve?

### 3. Know the People Behind It

* Follow core maintainers
* Read design discussions and RFCs
* Watch conference talks from the creators

This is where you learn **intent**, not just API usage.

### 4. Follow the Ecosystem

* Release notes
* GitHub issues and PRs
* Deprecations and breaking changes
* Security advisories

Daily exposure here matters-even if you don’t act on it immediately.

## How to Research the Product or Company

Engineering decisions never exist in isolation.

Research the **product context**:

* What problem does this product actually solve?
* What are the business constraints?
* Who are the users?
* What failure modes are acceptable?

The “best” technical solution in isolation can be the wrong one for the product.

Good research aligns engineering decisions with **business reality**.

## How to Research a Topic (Domain-Level Research)

Some topics require **continuous awareness**, not one-time learning.

For example: security, infrastructure, cloud, networking.

Good topic research includes:

* Reading industry news (not just blogs)
* Following vulnerability disclosures and advisories
* Attending meetups and conferences
* Talking to people actively working in the domain

Cybersecurity is a good example:
best practices expire faster than most documentation updates.

## The Learning Cycle (How Research Actually Works)

Research is not linear. It’s a loop:

1. Learn the basics
2. Build something
3. Hit limitations
4. Research deeper
5. Refactor your understanding
6. Repeat

Each loop makes earlier concepts clearer.

The best engineers revisit fundamentals-not because they forgot them, but because they now understand *why they matter*.

## Practical Tips That Actually Work

No hacks-just habits that scale:

* Use an RSS reader (blogs, release notes, security feeds)
* Follow official docs and changelogs, not just summaries
* Skim often, deep-read selectively
* Keep lightweight personal research notes
* Revisit old assumptions regularly

Daily research won’t feel rewarding.
Monthly reflection will.

## Closing Thought

Great software engineers aren’t defined by how fast they code, but by how well they research *before* and *while* coding.

If you want long-term growth, treat research as a **daily background process**, not a one-time task.
That’s the real D in R&D.
