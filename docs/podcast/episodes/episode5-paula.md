Episode 5 features Paula Medina Mora - HR Expert and Founder of MakingHR.

We peel back the curtain on the hiring world to see what actually happens "on the other side" of the desk. We talk about how to build a CV that stands out, the reality of the Spanish tech market, and how to navigate the recruitment process from the first LinkedIn message to signing the contract. An honest look at the human side of software engineering, with practical advice for developers at any level - and a cup of mate on the side.

**Topics we cover:** <br/>
- Effective Job Hunting: Reading job descriptions and knowing if you are the right fit.
- The "Recruiter's Lens": How HR searches for candidates.
- Behind the Scenes: Is the recruitment process safe and discrete for candidates?
- CV & LinkedIn: Balancing technical depth with impact to be "found" by recruiters.
- Certifications, Degrees, and Recommendations: What actually moves the needle?
- The Screening Call: What HR looks for in the first 15 minutes beyond technical skills.
- Negotiation & Contracts: Handling salary ranges and what to check in a Spanish "Convenio."
- Regional Context: The tech market in Galicia.
